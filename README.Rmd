## Introduction  

This R project reflects the data cleaning and analyses of the article
_The Role of Feedback on Students’ Diagramming: Effects on Monitoring Accuracy and Text Comprehension:_ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cedpsych.2023.102251

<b>Disclaimer and WARNING:</b>
This project is set-up in such a way that people without any programming background can understand and make use of the R scripts. The scripts are partly VERY long (think about 1500 lines of code).  
<b>I strongly recommend</b> folding the code to make navigation easier by:  
Navigating to Edit->Folding->Collapse All or, depending on the system you are using, with the shortcuts: alt+cmd+o or ctrl+alt+o

## Usage                      

### Less Experienced User:

   - Navigate to the Scripts folder and open + run the 'Package_Installation_Help.R' script   
   
You can then either

   - Open 'Article_1_Feedback_Standards_Output_Summary_Artificial_Data.Rmd' in the main directory and click 'knit'
   - Open and run any of the scripts located in the Scripts folder

### Experienced User:

  - You should be able to run all scripts (in /Scripts/) without pre-installing packages, this will be handled in the first part of each script (if the packages are not yet installed on your system).  
  - To knit the formatted output 'Article_1_Feedback_Standards_Output_Summary_Artificial_Data.Rmd' in the main directory, you will need to install 'rmdformats' first. 

```{r rmdformat installation, eval= FALSE}
install.packages("rmdformats")
```

If you do not use RMardown frequently, please run the 'Package_Installation_Help.R' in the Scripts folder first.
