## Introduction  

This R project reflects the data cleaning and analyses of the article
_The Role of Feedback on Students’ Diagramming: Effects on Monitoring Accuracy and Text Comprehension:_ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cedpsych.2023.102251  


For a more elaborate documentation, see Documentation.Rmd in the Documentation folder.

## Usage                      

### Less Experienced User:

   - Open the project using Rstudio by selecting <b>file</b> -> <b>new project</b> -> <b>version control</b> -> <b>git</b> and enter https://github.com/SopBra/NRO-PROO_Article_1_Effects_Of_Feedback_Standards_During_Diagramming

(Choose where you would like to store the project folder).

<b>To inspect the single data cleaning and analysis scripts:</b>

   - Open (via the files tab in RStudio) any of the scripts located in the Scripts folder, (select the whole script) and click Run

<b>To directly inspect the formatted output file of the analysis script:</b>

   - Open (via the files tab in RStudio) the Scripts folder and open + run the 'Package_Installation_Help.R' script
   - Open (via the files tab in RStudio) 'Article_1_Feedback_Standards_Output_Summary_Artificial_Data.Rmd' in the main directory and click 'knit'
   

### Experienced User:

  - You should be able to run all scripts (in /Scripts/) without pre-installing packages, this will be handled in the first part of each script (if the packages are not yet installed on your system).  
  - To knit the formatted output 'Article_1_Feedback_Standards_Output_Summary_Artificial_Data.Rmd' in the main directory, you will need to 
      -  run the two analysis scripts in Scripts/Scripts_Data_Analyses first, <b>OR</b>
      -  run the Package_Installation_Help.R in Scripts/ first.

### Disclaimer and WARNING:
This project is set-up in such a way that people without any programming background can understand and make use of the R scripts. The scripts are partly VERY long (think about 1500 lines of code).  
<b>I strongly recommend</b> folding the code to make navigation easier by:  

 -  <b>Navigating to Edit->Folding->Collapse All</b> or, 
 
 -  depending on the system you are using, with the <b>shortcuts: alt+cmd+o</b> or <b>ctrl+alt+o</b>
